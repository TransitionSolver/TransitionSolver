I will try to document things that a user needs to do manually to gte this running

1) CosmoTransitions needs to be installed or in your path somehow.  That is already the case for me and I think the cosmtransition examples assume that is the case but maybe worth stating explcitly (if released still with cosmotransiotions).

2) The path to PhaseTracer needs to be input by hand on the example files.  If there are a bunch of things like that may be worth pulling them out into a configure file or some such.

3) Read Lachlan's email and actually copy his modofied cosmotransitions file to the installed version of cosmotransitions

4) For python 3.7 and 3.8 add from __future__ import annotations to
* BarebonesExample.py
* PipelineExample.py
* PhaseHistoryAnalysis.py
* TransitionAnalysis.py

5)  Checkout correct branch of PT.   Note the branch is actually caller TransitionSolverIntegration

$  You also need to make and build PT on that branch as it neesds the new executable run_ToyModel 
python3 BarebonesExample.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/pathron/software/TransitionSolver-demo/PhaseStructure.py", line 278, in load_data
    with open(dat_name) as d:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'output/example3/phase_structure.dat'
Could not find phase structure file.


6) Finally in addition to removing the "wsl", you need to modify

subprocess.call([PHASETRACER_DIR + 'bin/run_ToyModel', outputFolder + '/parameter_point.txt', outputFolder],timeout=60, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
->
subprocess.call([PHASETRACER_DIR + 'bin/run_ToyModel', outputFolder + '/parameter_point.txt', outputFolder], timeout=60, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
